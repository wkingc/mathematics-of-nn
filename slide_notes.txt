- Overall I need to ground the math in real life use cases.
- Translate why the audience cares about this in the OIG perspective.
- Jargon that vendors that might use.  Just matrix math and derivatives at the end of the day.
- At the end ask the question why now?  How long ago was actualy framework created.  Compute and data.
- Topics haven't during addressed:  Bias
- Facial recognition for crime
- Hullucinations in Neural Network
- How to choose number of layers and neurons per layer.  Also stop condition for optimization.
- Does number of layers matter to an auditor?
- Adversarial attacks on models
- Policy vs. Ethics:  This is about not math, not policy or ethics, but knowing the math can help drive policy and ethics.
- Math looking at edges.  Looking at edges of car instead patterns of dots and pictures.
- Explainable AI.
- Preparing data is a big deal.  What is the data trained on and how that that effect generalizability?  Silicon valley resumes.
- Any time relate it back to a real world idea.  Important for them to hear the words.  Going down a hill.  Stick figure walking down a graph.  Anything that can be more graspable.
- This is a good demonstration of lay speak to get people to understand the mathematical part.  

# Why Learn the Mathematics of Deep Learning?

I see it as internal uses of AI vs doing oversight of AI.

# 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics @nobel2024

# Applications to the Oversight Mission

Move information in this slide to slide 2 (# Why Learn the Mathematics of Deep Learning?).
Using AI for OIG work and overseeing agency AI models.

# The Deep in Deep Learning

# Preliminaries

Can this be said instead?

# Matricies

State oraly why we care about matricies.  A matrix is how data are stored.

# Matrix Translation

# Matrix Transformation

# Matrix Transformation:  Scale

# Matrix Transformation:  Rotation

Just show in pictures instead of show matrix?

# Rate of Change:  The Derivative

# Rate of Change: The Gradient

8 slides on the math.  Seems like a lot of math.  Great stuff on math but too much.

Say exactly at the beginning why the math is needed and then move through it relatively quickly.  Won't be banboozeld by other people.

# Deep Learning Intuition I

Associate real life example with the picture in the slide.

# Deep Learning Intuition II

# Deep Learning Roadmap:  Layers

# Representation of a Single-Layer Neural Network

Say the X could be a number -- anything with a mathematical representation.  Pixel image, numerical representation of a sound, ect.

# Representation of a Two-Layer Neural Network

# What Is $\varrho(h)$ and Why Do We Need It?

Rework this slide:  Remove proof
Detect non-linear features

# Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)

Additional mathematical steps to get more accurate.  Detect non-linear features.

# Deep Learning Roadmap:  Loss

- Just call it loss, not loss function.

# Measures of Loss

# Forward Pass I

# Forward Pass II

- Use english to explain.  X are the inputs.  What is X?  X is a mathmetical represetnation of a sound byte, image.

# Deep Learning Roadmap:  Optimization

# Gradient Descent I

- Think about a stick man walking down the curve

# Gradient Descent II

# A Note About Calculating Gradients

- Too many words.  Use an image instead.

# Backward Pass

- Model will be used to make a forecast from new data.  Detecting a pedestrian crossing the streed.

# A Real Example:  Digit Image Classification

# A Real Example:  Data Setup

# A Real Example:  Model Setup

# A Real Example:  Model Compilation

# A Real Example:  Model Fit

# Summary

Tie back to slide 4 (applications to the oversight mission).  Tie it back to why they care.
